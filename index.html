  <h1>A Baby Born in a Hurricane</h1>
  <p>
    In 1988, Hexx decided to make the most epic entrance into this world while Hurricane Alberta was also making land in Southeast Texas. Momma always said I can never do anything easy. 
  </p>

  <h1>A Life Long Learner</h1>
  <p>
    I attended a culturally diverse elementary, middle and high school in little ol' Port Neches, Texas. A tiny country town built around 9 refinaries and a river port to bring all that oil money in. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Later, I was awarded a full scholoship to Lamar University for Speech and Debate and became the univeristy's youngest national debate champion during my freshman year. I graudated with B.A. in General Studies and accepted a working internship at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Fl. At Disney, I attended classes and discussions hosted by Disney professionals and worked in conservation at Disney's Animal Kingdom around 49 different african species.  
  </p>
  <p>
    A few years later, I was attracted to cosmetology and obtained my licese in North Carolina with the Paul Mitchell School. I traveled with my school to Las Vegas for the largest student hair show in the country and attended class there as well. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Fast forward a few more years and I start working in body modification and I find myself certified in  blood borne pathogens and studying gemology, diamondology and gold smithing.  During this time, I also took classes in safe practices with the Association of Professional Piercers. 
  </p>

  <h1>A Jill of All Trades</h1>
  <p>
    My work history starts as a young teenager working at the local dirt racetrack with my dad and younger brother. There I learned basic working skills and even a little about cars, engines and offensive driving.  
  </p>
  <p>
    After my working internship with Disney World, I spent the rest of my 20's discovering craft cocktails and artisan coffee. I worked numerous jobs in the food service industry across many states. Food service taught me how to hustle, patience and how to sell myself.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my more recent years, I moved into luxury retail and body modification. This is the first job I've ever had where I needed better office tools to help develop my staff and business procedures. This need jump started my curiosity about code.

  <h1>Branding Title Here</h1><!--Figure out your branding first then come up with a catchy title for your goals section-->
    <p>
      Growing up has brought me so much awareness about the world. I have worked so many different jobs, in many different places and for many different kinds of people. The two things I have learned is that we are not as safe as we think we are and we need more help. My current goal is to help alleviate those two basic human needs through code. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My goals start with completing coding classes 101-401 with Code Fellows to set me up for success upon accepting my first tech job. Then I would like to continue my education with Code Fellows through their Cyber Ops courses in hopes of focusing my career on cyber security.
